  <h3>Terms of use.</h3>
  <p>
    Terms and conditions are not required by law, but are extremely important to the long-term success and viability of your website. Having website terms and conditions is considered standard business practice in the US, Canada, the UK, and just about everywhere else â€” from South Africa to Australia. 
   </p>


  <h3>Conditions</h3>
  <p>
    If you plan to grow your business or expand your user base, a simple terms and conditions agreement will provide your website with an additional layer of legal protection, and allow you to maintain your rights.
