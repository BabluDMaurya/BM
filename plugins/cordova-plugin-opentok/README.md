To use the opentok library, make sure you include `opentok.js` file in your HTML document.  
` <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="opentok.js"></script>`

All JavaScript code should be written in `onDeviceReady` function in `/js/index.js` because it is executed after all dependencies has loaded.

    onDeviceReady: function() {
        // Do Your Stuff Here!
    }
